# Overlook Hotel: A Hotel Booking Application

## Front-End Project by: [Beth Meeker](https://github.com/Meekb)

## Overview
  Overlook Hotel is a Turing School project allowing students to build a hotel booking application that tracks a customer's booking history and calculates the total cost of all bookings in the users history. New bookings are posted via fetch API, reducing the available rooms for a given book date.

## Construction
  
  * 4 Classes, each accompanied by a test file: Hotel, Room, Booking, Customer
  * Login page requires valid username and password (username: customer < 1 thru 50 > password: overlook2021)
  * Employed breakpoint at 768px for responsive design enjoyable on desktop, or tablet
  * Deployment to GitHub Pages coming Soon!

Providing Incorrect Username or Password will throw an error!
